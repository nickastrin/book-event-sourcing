# Book Tracker
A modern, full-stack book management application designed for speed and clarity. 
Built with React 19, .NET 9, and Marten (PostgreSQL), this app allows users to track their books, manage authors, and filter through their library with a highly responsive UI.
The key feature of this application is the activity log shown for each book. This was implemented using event sourcing, to ensure data consistency and speed.
